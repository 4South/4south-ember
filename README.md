##Why is this useful?##
This package provides a organizational base for your code that will allow you to write manageable and large javascript applications
in Ember.js without wanting to pull your hair out.

Watch tasks and browser livereload will greatly improve the speed of prototyping, styling, and debugging.  These are amazing improvements!

##The major features are:##

**coffeescript compilation** (optional and changeable)<br />
**handlebars compilation** (uses ember-specific JST wrapping)<br />
**sass compilation** (optional and changeable)<br />
**minispade module system** (excellent lightweight module loading system built by Yehuda Katz)
**file watching** (watch changes in coffee,handlebars,js,and sass files)
**browser livereload** (anytime a watched file changes, your browser will reload automatically after re-compilation)
